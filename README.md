# Python Coding Sample
Contains some interesting homework from CS 189 introduction to machine learning at UC Berkeley

### HW3 Problem:
    This is about choosing reasonale learning rate for batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent with 
    l2 regularization. Then plot the cost function as a function of the number of iterations.
